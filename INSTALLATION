As Plasmid DB is based on the CodeIgniter Framework, the same installation procedure applies.

Plasmid DB requires an MySQL database, Apache with mod_rewrite and php 5 to run.

Step 1:
*Download the installation zip, extract the files and copy them to your webserver.
*The img/vectormap, pdf and tmp directory need to be made writeable for the webserver (set permission to 777)

Step 2:
*Set up a plasmid db user in your database (needs read and write permission) and create a new table for plasmid db
*Run the SQL script "database/plasmiddb.sql" to create the database tables and a default admin account
*Note: remove "database/plasmiddb.sql" from the webserver

Step 3: 
*In case the website is not in the main domain: edit .htaccess. Replace "RewriteBase /" with "RewriteBase /plasmid_db_folder/".
*Set the base url in "application/contif/config.php": $config['base_url'] = "http://your_url_here.net"; 
*Set up the database connection in "application/contif/database.php"
*Set up the email system in "application/contif/email.php" (or disable notifications here)

Step 4:
*Log in using user "admin" and password "admin"
*Change the admin password
*Using the admin account to add locations of offices and storage rooms
*Register for an account and approve it using the admin account

    		<h2>About</h2>
			<p>Laboratories are highly dynamic workplaces were short-term contracts are common. In molecular biology this creates a problem and resources, such as plasmids, which cannot be traced are often rendered useless or lost. As these resources cost time and money to prepare and store this can be a financial loss, perhaps even worse is that it can hinder the repetition of an experiment and thus the replication of results.</p>
			<p>As our group is distributed over various labs in different buildings this posed an additional challenge to maintain an overview of who was storing what and where. Therefore a centralized solution needed to be implemented to overcome these issues. Plasmid DB was created as a solution to these problems. This platform offers a user-friendly interface, accessible on-line through any recent browser to a modern database solution. This provides lab managers a way to keep track of material in our collection, while allowing researchers to find material they need and add resources they created.</p>
